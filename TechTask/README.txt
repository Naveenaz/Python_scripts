Test_Plan
	Test_Plan_Replacer_Naveen_Zunjarwad -- Test Plan    ( Test plan can be improved by adding Usability tests, performance tests etc based on application. For this I just added
								functional tests as described in task)




Please note following:

	-I was not entirely sure where to stop in adding new test cases. So I added 4 new test cases. Hope thats enough for this task.
	-Test plan can be improved based on the application and could have added different types of testing. For this task, I have used formal standard template.
	Could be improved further.
	-Please note my assumptions I made while writing code for "replacer()" function which I have highlighted in Test Plan.
	-Please note my comments in source code.
